# ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Panels Power Prediction using XGBoost  

This project predicts the power output of solar panels using **XGBoost regression models**, trained separately for each season ‚Äî **Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall**.  
Each seasonal model was trained on approximately **100,000 samples** to capture the unique environmental and weather patterns affecting solar power generation throughout the year.  

By using **XGBoost exclusively**, the system achieves consistent high accuracy and efficiency across all datasets.  
The seasonal split enhances adaptability to real-world conditions, ensuring each model performs optimally for its respective time of year.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features  

### ‚úÖ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
- Removes missing and duplicate records  
- Handles nighttime power values by setting negatives to zero  
- Performs linear interpolation for continuous time-series data  
- Drops unnecessary time-related columns after processing  
- Automatically detects and merges duplicate timestamps by averaging numeric columns  

---

### ‚úÖ Feature Selection  
- Uses **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)** for each season to find the most influential features  
- Automatically detects and stores the model-used features  
- Ensures that only relevant features are used during training and prediction  
- Enhances interpretability and reduces noise in seasonal datasets  

---

### ‚úÖ Model Training  
- Trains an **XGBoost Regressor** for each season using optimized hyperparameters  
- Each model is trained on **100,000 samples** of cleaned and preprocessed data  
- Compares model performance across all seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)  
- Saves the best trained model for each season as `xgb_{season}.joblib`  
- Uses consistent architecture and evaluation pipeline to ensure reliability  

---

### ‚úÖ Evaluation Metrics  
- **R¬≤**, **MSE**, **RMSE** per season  
- **RMSE** also expressed as a percentage of total system capacity  
- 5-fold cross-validation for stability and robustness  
- Detailed logging of model performance after each training phase  

---

### ‚úÖ Web Deployment  
- Interactive web interface built with **FastAPI**  
- User selects a season and inputs feature values to get real-time predictions  
- Clean, bilingual UI 
- Displays output in a clear format
